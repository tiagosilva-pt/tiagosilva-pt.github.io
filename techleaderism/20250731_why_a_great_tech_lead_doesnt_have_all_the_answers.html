<p>There's a widespread belief that a tech lead needs to have all the answers, but in reality, the best tech leads know that their strength lies in asking the right questions, not in being the sole problem-solver.</p>
<p>A tech lead's role goes beyond technical decisions, it's about guiding the team, aligning with the business, and fostering collaboration across departments. Trying to provide all the answers often stifles team creativity and slows growth. When the lead always jumps in with a solution, it creates dependency and discourages others from thinking critically. But when a tech lead says, "I don't know - what do you think?", they empower the team to take ownership and grow their problem-solving skills.</p>
<p>It also prevents burnout. Carrying the weight of every decision is unsustainable and pulls a lead away from strategic thinking. Sharing responsibility and trusting the team builds a more resilient, innovative culture.</p>
<p>Ultimately, a great tech lead isn't the one who knows everything. It's the one who listens, guides, and creates space for others to thrive. Leadership isn't about having all the answers, it's about helping the team find them together.</p>
