<p>Hemingway's The Sun Also Rises is not a book on leadership. It is a story of disillusionment, of a generation wounded by war, drifting between Paris and Spain in search of meaning. But, when read through the lens of leadership, the novel offers profound lessons.</p>
<p>The protagonist, Jake Barnes, is not a leader in any formal sense. He does not command authority, nor does he impose his will. Yet his quiet integrity, his ability to remain composed amidst chaos, and his authenticity make him a point of reference for others. In contrast, the rest of the group often becomes lost in ego, conflict, and the endless pursuit of distraction.</p>
<p>Hemingway reminds us that leadership is not always about titles or formal structures. It is about presence, about giving direction when others are adrift, and about managing the complex human dynamics that arise in any team. The absence of purpose in the so-called "lost generation" underlines the necessity of vision: without meaning, people drift apart.</p>
<p>Perhaps most striking is the novel's use of bullfighting as metaphor. In the ring, courage, discipline, and dignity under pressure stand in stark contrast to the confusion of the expatriates. The message is clear: leadership is less about control and more about facing uncertainty with honesty, resilience, and grace.</p>
