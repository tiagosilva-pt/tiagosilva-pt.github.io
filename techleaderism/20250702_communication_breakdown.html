<h2 class="article-title">Communication breakdown</h2>

<p>When major systems go down, we often point to a misconfigured script, a faulty deployment, or a routing
                error. But if we look more closely, the real culprit is often much more fundamental: a breakdown in
                communication.</p>
<p>In the past few years, we've seen this pattern play out in high-profile outages at Atlassian, Facebook,
                and Slack - companies known for engineering excellence. Despite having top-tier infrastructure, each of
                these organizations faced cascading failures made worse by internal misunderstandings, unclear
                responsibilities, or missing escalation paths.</p>
<p>In April 2022, Atlassian experienced a severe outage that affected over 400 customer sites - some for
                nearly two weeks. The root cause wasn't a novel technical failure, but a routine deletion script that
                was misunderstood. The parameters were wrongly set, and different teams had differing assumptions about
                the scope and safety of the operation. Without a clear handover or validation process, live customer
                environments were accidentally taken down. The recovery effort was slow, not due to lack of expertise,
                but because the communication channels and documentation weren't aligned to handle such a situation
                swiftly.</p>
<p>In October 2021, Facebook went dark globally for six hours. The trigger was a change to network routing
                configurations, but the real issue was the lack of internal alignment on failure scenarios. The update
                removed Facebook's services - including internal tools - from the internet. With critical systems
                offline, teams couldn't communicate, access internal dashboards, or even enter the data centers. A
                single misjudged assumption about rollback procedures and internal tool independence turned a manageable
                change into a complete operational paralysis.</p>
<p>Slack's January 2021 outage followed a similar theme. A misconfiguration in internal traffic routing
                triggered widespread degradation just as the world was returning from the holidays. During the incident,
                different engineering teams held conflicting mental models of what was failing. This misalignment led to
                duplicated effort, delayed diagnosis, and inconsistent messaging to customers. The systems were complex
                - but the real challenge was creating a shared understanding fast enough to respond effectively.</p>
<p>These incidents show us that technical excellence alone isn't enough. In complex, fast-moving
                environments, the quality of internal communication - before, during, and after an incident - is what
                determines resilience. Systems fail. What matters is how we talk to each other when they do.
            </p>
<p>Communication is infrastructure.</p>
