<p>I've been actively exploring large language models (LLMs) and chatbots, particularly since the release of
                DeepSeek. Working with them both in the cloud and locally, I've applied them to various scenarios-from
                software development and finance to mentoring, data analysis, and even travel planning.</p>
<p>Recently, I was analyzing a very large dataset and ran into a roadblock: the file size was simply too
                large for the LLM to process effectively. I tried several approaches-cleaning, transforming,
                compressing, and even splitting the data into smaller chunks. In essence, I was adapting my problem to
                fit the tool.</p>
<p>Then, in one of my iterations, something unexpected happened. The LLM itself suggested that perhaps I was
                using the wrong tool for the job. And it was right. I was so focused on making the problem work within
                the constraints of an LLM that I overlooked more suitable solutions.</p>
<p>It was a classic case of "when all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail." This experience
                was a great reminder that while LLMs are incredibly powerful, they are not a one-size-fits-all solution.
                Choosing the right tool for the task is just as important as understanding the problem itself.</p>
