<p>There's a lot of talk about observability these days, and it's easy to confuse it with monitoring. But
                the difference really matters - especially as systems get more complex.</p>
<p>Monitoring is about tracking known things. You define metrics and thresholds, set up alerts, and wait to
                be told when something breaks. It's reactive. You already know the kinds of problems you're looking for,
                and you build tools to catch them.</p>
<p>Observability, on the other hand, is about answering questions you didn't know you'd need to ask. It's
                about understanding how your systems behave, diagnosing the unexpected, and making smarter decisions
                based on real data - not assumptions. It's a proactive and exploratory approach to understand the
                internal state of a system by examining its external outputs.</p>
<p>In practice, observability is about putting the right structures in place to see and understand what your
                systems are doing - all the time, not just when things go wrong. You start by identifying which metrics
                actually matter for your business and your users - like response times, error rates, or system
                throughput. Then, you instrument your code to capture useful logs, traces, and metrics. Tools like
                OpenTelemetry can help make that process more consistent.</p>
<p>From there, you build dashboards that highlight what's important and set alerts that trigger on real
                issues, not noise. Popular tools like Prometheus, Grafana, and the ELK stack make this possible, and
                platforms like Datadog or New Relic can bring everything into one place.</p>
<p>But tools alone aren't enough. Observability has to be part of how the team works. That means using data
                in retros, reviewing patterns after incidents, and making decisions based on what's actually happening
                in your systems - not just what you hope is happening.</p>
<p>When observability is done right, your team detects and solves problems faster, your systems run more
                reliably, and decisions get made with more confidence. You spend less time guessing and more time
                improving. And instead of reacting to issues, you start anticipating them - and building better systems
                because of it.</p>
<p>Observability isn't about collecting more data or spinning up endless dashboards. It's about clarity.
                It's about helping your team ask better questions, spot issues early, and stay aligned with what really
                matters - both technically and to the business.</p>
